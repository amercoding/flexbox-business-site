        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <h3>We are a startup that enables online retailers to provide their customers with an option to return their merchandise
          in a responsible and sustainable way. We 
          embrace the idea that everyone would happily make small steps to do good to our planet. 
           Our solution reduces the carbon footprint created by wasteful shipping and re-packaging  
           of returns, and it eliminates the restocking cost. Everybody wins! </h3>

            <h4>Instead of returning the item to the retailer, good returners forward the item to another buyer
               in their area using a prepaid anonimized shipping label we provide. No wasteful
              shipping back to the retailer. With this simple solution, everyone wins: the retailer, the planet,
              and good returners. Why didn't anybody think of it before? Good question.

            <h4>For returns that need to be shipped back to the retailer, we provide a network of local return 
              processing hubs called GoodHolders (GH). GH locations accept return drop offs, process the returns, 
             and serve as remote inventory warehouses for retailers. They are also discount brick-and-mortar stores. 
             The chery on top: they are franchises.

            <h4>Taking care of our planet is a community effort that deserves to be recognized. Each successful Good Returns transaction
               earns the buyer GR reward points. Members of the GR community can track their rewards in their
                GR Rewards account and earn status based on their history. The GR rewards can be exchanged for merchandise or donated towards the efforts to 
                help the nature heal.
